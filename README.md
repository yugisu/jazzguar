# jazzguar `📸🐆🎶`

A photo management web app leveraging AI capabilities. Created during the Fluxon AI hackathon.

The idea behind Jazzguar comes from a personal issue of organizing a navigable photo storage. This tool aims to make stored photos easy to traverse by categorizing them and allowing to query these categories using natural language. For labeling, which happens upon the image upload, it uses Google Cloud Vision API (https://cloud.google.com/vision); for querying categories, it uses Anthropic Claude with a prompt crafted for this purpose. This allows for quick image search, suitable for personal image galleries.
